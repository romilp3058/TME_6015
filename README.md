To run the code from the start, the only requirement to be followed is to place the dataset in the same directory as the code.
The dataset couldn't be uploaded even after compressing it due to large size.
To work around it, the entire code, "TME_6015_FINAL_PROJECT.ipynb" with the executed cells containing the outputs displayed can be viewed. 
A screenshot, Dataset_Folder_screenshot.jpeg, displaying the dataset folders, folder info and images containing both the original and augmented images has been uploaded.
The project report, "TME_FINAL_Project_REPORT.pdf", contains screenshots of the project implementation in action.
"stop_video-3.mp4" contains the video of the output from the model. The video was taken on the streets of Fredericton and fed to the model. It is an example of how the project can be utilized for downstreaming. 
"best.pt" contains the trained weights of the best performing model, i.e, YOLOv8n.
model files for YOLO v8n, v9t and v10n are also available.
